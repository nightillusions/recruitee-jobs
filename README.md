## Frequently Asked Questions

### How to use the shortcode?

In the visual editor you can simply add a new Shortcode block by clicking on the [+] icon.
Then search for `Shortcode` and click on it. Next you add your own recruitee shortcode like `[recruitee-jobs company="yourcompany"]`
in the input field. ThatÂ´s it! :)
