## Frequently Asked Questions

### How to use the shortcode?

First you have to replace the company tag value by your Recruitee Careers Site subdomain. The scheme looks like this: `https://`**`yourcompany`**`.recruitee.com`
Where **`yourcompany`** is your Recruitee subdomain. You can usually find this in your Recruitee administration interface.

In the visual editor you can simply add a new Shortcode block by clicking on the [+] icon.
Then search for `Shortcode` and click on it. Next you add your own recruitee shortcode in the input field
(e.g.: `[recruitee-jobs company="`**`yourcompany`**`"]` ).
ThatÂ´s it! :)

### How do I style the jobs?

Just override the css classes that are used in this plugin. Follow the CSS Cascade to find your best solution https://wattenberger.com/blog/css-cascade
For example you could change the background color of the box:

    .recruitee-jobs-container article.recruitee-job {
        background: #dcff8c;
    }

Or the text color of the title:

    .recruitee-jobs-container a {
        color: #322d7e;
    }
